# Encapsulation of UI Components

## Overview

The encapsulation of UI components promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability of the codebase. This principle emphasizes that external components should not modify the internal structure or appearance of UI components directly. Instead, any desired changes should be achieved through the component's designated interface, such as props or state.

## Guideline

To adhere to this principle, follow these guidelines when working with UI components:

1. **Avoid modifying UI components externally:** Resist the temptation to add class names or apply custom changes directly to UI components from external components. Doing so can introduce dependencies and break encapsulation.

2. **Extend component functionality via props:** If you need to use a component with a different state, variant, or size, it is recommended to extend the component itself rather than modifying it externally. This can be accomplished by introducing new variants, sizes, or properties to the component and utilizing them through props.

3. **Maintain a clear separation of concerns:** Ensure that each UI component is responsible for its own behavior and appearance. By encapsulating these responsibilities, components can be reused in various contexts without affecting their core functionality.

4. **Document component interfaces and limitations:** Clearly document the available props, states, and any limitations or constraints of the UI components. This documentation will help other developers understand the intended usage and prevent unintended modifications.

5. **Utilize composition and inheritance:** When adding new functionality or customizations to UI components, prefer composition and inheritance over direct modification. This approach allows for easier maintenance and extension of the components in the long term.

6. **Promote using design system:** Sometimes designers might use components which are not part of the design system. Let's say a tiny modification in a button which force the developer to modify the UI externally for an specific case. Call out that we can't implement that component because it's not part of the design system. Action plan should be like this:

   1. Ask the designer to introduce the new case in the component.
   2. Upgrade the component in the FE with the new case.
   3. Finally use the new case where it was initially required.

## Benefits

By adhering to the encapsulation of UI components, you can achieve several benefits:

- **Modularity:** Encapsulated components are self-contained and can be reused across different parts of the application, promoting code modularity and reducing duplication.

- **Reusability:** UI components that are not tightly coupled with external components are more reusable, allowing for faster development and easier maintenance.

- **Maintainability:** Encapsulation helps isolate changes within a component, making it easier to locate and update specific functionality or appearance without impacting other parts of the application.

- **Consistency:** By using props and well-defined interfaces, components can maintain a consistent appearance and behavior throughout the application.

- **Collaboration:** Clear documentation of component interfaces and limitations promotes better collaboration among developers, as it provides a shared understanding of how components should be used and customized.

## Conclusion

Following the principle of encapsulation for UI components will lead to a more robust and maintainable codebase. By avoiding external modifications and utilizing props or state to introduce variations, you can create reusable components that are easy to maintain and extend. Remember to document component interfaces and encourage a separation of concerns to ensure the principle is upheld throughout your codebase.
