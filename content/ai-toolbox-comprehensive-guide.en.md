# AI Toolbox: A Comprehensive Development Guide

Modern software development has been revolutionized by AI-powered tools. This comprehensive guide explores a complete AI toolbox that enhances development workflows through GitHub Copilot configurations, specialized chat modes, reusable prompt templates, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integrations.

## What is the AI Toolbox?

The AI Toolbox is a curated collection of AI development tools designed to streamline modern development workflows. It provides standardized configurations and templates that make AI assistance more effective and consistent across different development scenarios.

### Key Components

The toolbox consists of four main components:

1. **GitHub Copilot Instructions**: Comprehensive guidelines for AI assistants
2. **Chat Modes**: Specialized configurations for different team roles and AI tools
3. **Prompt Templates**: Reusable prompts for common development tasks
4. **MCP Servers**: Model Context Protocol integrations for external tools

## Repository Structure

The AI Toolbox follows a well-organized structure that makes it easy to navigate and use:

## GitHub Copilot Instructions

The cornerstone of the AI Toolbox is a comprehensive set of GitHub Copilot instructions that provide detailed guidelines for AI assistants working with modern frontend applications.

### Project Guidelines

The instructions cover essential aspects of project development:

- **Technology Stack**: TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and modern web technologies
- **Naming Conventions**: Strict conventions for files, components, and variables
- **Folder Structure**: Organized approach to code organization
- **Component Guidelines**: Best practices for React component development

### Key Principles

The instructions emphasize several key principles:

1. **Presentational Components Only**: UI components should be purely presentational
2. **No Data Fetching**: Components should not perform API calls
3. **No Global State**: Components should not manage global state
4. **HTML Tag Mapping**: Every HTML tag should have a corresponding React component

### Code Generation Guidelines

The instructions provide specific guidelines for code generation:

- Use TypeScript interfaces for all props and data structures
- Follow strict naming conventions (kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components)
- Implement proper component composition with children props
- Use single `useState` pattern when state is needed
- Avoid props destructuring, use `props.propName` pattern

## Chat Modes for Team Roles

One of the most innovative aspects of the AI Toolbox is its collection of specialized chat modes designed for different team roles and AI tools.
