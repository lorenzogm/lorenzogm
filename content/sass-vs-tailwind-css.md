# SASS vs Tailwind CSS

## SASS is better

- Tailwind CSS can't do everything, SASS is required anyway. So we get styles in 2 places.
- Less complexity: with design tokens and CSS variables, no need to create and maintain a Tailwind CSS config.
- It scales better for features and design tokens.

## Tailwind is better

- Tailwind is faster for layouts. (Might be less important for multiple CMS).
- Less repetitive.
- Intellisense is better in VSCode.
